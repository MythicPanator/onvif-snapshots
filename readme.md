> Compleatly overengineered — and gloriously within hobby budget.

This project captures periodic snapshots from an **ONVIF‑compatible camera** and publishes them through an Azure‑hosted static website.  
It is optimised for **near‑zero monthly cost** using:

* **Azure Functions (Consumption)** — timer‑triggered sampler  
* **Azure Blob Storage** — stores original timeline plus a fixed **`latest/`** alias  
* **Static Website** (or public container) — exposes images via stable URLs

## Infrastructure (`infra.bicep`)

| Resource | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| **Storage Account** (`staticWebsite.enabled = true`) | container `snapshots`, public read |
| **Azure Function App** (Python 3.11, Y1 plan) | timer cron `0 */30 * * * *` |
| **Application Insights** | diagnostics |

Deploy:

```bash
az deployment group create -g <ResourceGroup> -f infra.bicep -p projectPrefix=snapshot
```

Outputs include `storageUrl` for quick access.

## Retention & Cost Plan

This project stores **16 images per day** (4 camera angles × 4 daily time periods), each around ~0.5 MB.  
That’s roughly **8 MB/day** or **2.9 GB/year**, with automatic tiering:

- **Hot** storage (first 30 days)
- → **Cool** (next 60 days)
- → **Archive** thereafter

### Projected 5‑Year Storage Cost

| Tier    | Capacity | Price/GB | Monthly Cost |
|---------|----------|----------|---------------|
| Hot     | ~0.7 GB  | \$0.0184 | \$0.01        |
| Cool    | ~0.6 GB  | \$0.0100 | \$0.006       |
| Archive | ~12.2 GB | \$0.0010 | \$0.01        |

**Total:** ~ **\$0.03/month** by year 5  
~**\$2 total over 5 years**, assuming low traffic and standard usage.

⚠️ **Note on Azure Costs**

While this setup is tuned for minimal cost, be mindful of other factors:

- **Azure Functions** (Consumption Plan) is free up to generous limits  
- **Application Insights** can incur cost if logging is too verbose  
- **Blob bandwidth** is free up to 5 GB/month — traffic spikes may exceed that  
- **Storage growth** is managed via lifecycle rules — disable them and it grows forever  
- **Function timers** should stay modest (e.g. every 30 minutes, not every minute)

> This works well for low-frequency, low-traffic, public-good projects — but if you embed the images in a popular website or remove safeguards, **you could absolutely rack up costs.**

Always monitor your usage in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), set spending alerts, and test changes on a throwaway subscription first if unsure.

This repo is offered with the **best intent** — but **you’re responsible** for your own cloud bill.
